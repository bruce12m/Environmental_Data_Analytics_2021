## LESSON OBJECTIVES

1.  Describe the purpose of using R Markdown as a communication and workflow tool
2.  Incorporate Markdown syntax into documents
3.  Communicate the process and findings of an analysis session in the style of a report

## USE OF R STUDIO & R MARKDOWN SO FAR...

1.  Write code
2.  Document that code
3.  Generate PDFs of code and its outputs
4.  Integrate with Git/GitHub for version control

## BASIC R MARKDOWN DOCUMENT STRUCTURE

1. **YAML Header** surrounded by --- on top and bottom
    + YAML templates include options for html, pdf, word, markdown, and interactive
    + More information on formatting the YAML header can be found in the cheat sheet
2. **R Code Chunks** surrounded by ``` on top and bottom
    + Create using `Cmd/Ctrl` + `Alt` + `I`
    + Can be named {r name} to facilitate navigation and autoreferencing
    + Chunk options allow for flexibility when the code runs and when the document is knitted
3. **Text** with formatting options for readability in knitted document

## THE KNITTING PROCESS
-   The knitting sequence
    ![knitting](../lessons/img/rmarkdownflow.png)

* Knitting commands in code chunks:
 - `include = FALSE` - code is run, but neither code nor results appear in knitted file
 - `echo = FALSE`    - code not included in knitted file, but results are
 - `eval = FALSE`    - code is not run in the knitted file
 - `message = FALSE` - messages do not appear in knitted file
 - `warning = FALSE` - warnings do not appear...
 - `fig.cap = "..."` - adds a caption to graphical results

## WHAT ELSE CAN R MARKDOWN DO?

See: <https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com> and class recording. 
 * Languages other than R...
 * Various outputs...
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Why is R Markdown so great? 

* Everthing is in __one place__
* It's __reproducaible__ from one report/assignment to the next 
* You can have _text explanations right alongside your code_
* R is fairly easy for __troubleshooting__

## TEXT EDITING CHALLENGE

Create a table below that details the example datasets we have been using in class. The first column should contain the names of the datasets and the second column should include some relevant information about the datasets. (Hint: use the cheat sheets to figure out how to make a table in Rmd)

Dataset                  | Information: dimensions
-----------------------  | -----------------------
EPAair_O3_NC2019_raw     | 10592 X 20
EPAair_PM25_NC2019_raw   | 8581 X 20
EPAair_O3_NC2018_raw     | 9737 X 20
EPAair_PM25_NC2018_raw   | 8983 X 20

## R CHUNK EDITING CHALLENGE

### Installing packages

Create an R chunk below that installs the package `knitr`. Instead of commenting out the code, customize the chunk options such that the code is not evaluated (i.e., not run).

```{r install.packages, eval = FALSE}

install.packages('knitr')
install.packages('RColorBrewer')

```

### Setup

Create an R chunk below called "setup" that checks your working directory, loads the packages `tidyverse`, `lubridate`, and `knitr`, and sets a ggplot theme. Remember that you need to disable R throwing a message, which contains a check mark that cannot be knitted.

```{r setup, message = FALSE}

# Check working directory 
getwd()

# Load packages 
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(knitr)
library(RColorBrewer)

# Set ggplot theme 
mytheme <- theme_classic(base_size = 12) +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(color = "black"), 
        legend.position = "right", 
        panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "gray")) 
theme_set(mytheme)

```

Load the NTL-LTER_Lake_Nutrients_Raw dataset, display the head of the dataset, and set the date column to a date format.Customize the chunk options such that the code is run but is not displayed in the final document.

```{r load data, echo = FALSE}

# Providing full paths b/c RStudio on my VM won't process the relative paths
# I recognize that relative paths are preferable

# Load NTL-LTER_Lake_Nutrients_Raw dataset
LTER <- read.csv("C:/Users/mmb88/Desktop/Environmental_Data_Analytics_2021/Data/Raw/NTL-LTER_Lake_Nutrients_Raw.csv")

# Display head of dataset
head(LTER)

# Set data column to date format
LTER$sampledate <- as.Date(LTER$sampledate, format = "%m/%d/%y")

```

### Data Exploration, Wrangling, and Visualization

Create an R chunk below to create a processed dataset do the following operations:

-   Include all columns except lakeid, depth_id, and comments
-   Include only surface samples (depth = 0 m)
-   Drop rows with missing data

```{r process}

# Create processed dataset
LTER <- LTER %>% 
  # Select designated columns 
  select(lakename:sampledate, depth:po4) %>%
  # Include only surface samples 
  filter(depth == 0) %>% 
  # Drop rows with missing data 
  drop_na()

```

Create a second R chunk to create a summary dataset with the mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation of total nitrogen concentrations for each lake. Create a second summary dataset that is identical except that it evaluates total phosphorus. Customize the chunk options such that the code is run but not displayed in the final document.

```{r summarize, echo = FALSE}

# Create summary dataset for Nitrogen 
LTER_summary_n <- LTER %>% 
    group_by(lakename) %>%
    # Summarize mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation 
    summarize(mean_tn = mean(tn_ug),
              max_tn = max(tn_ug),
              min_tn = min(tn_ug),
              sd_tn = sd(tn_ug))

# Create summary dataset for Phosphorus 
LTER_summary_p <- LTER %>% 
    group_by(lakename) %>%
    # Summarize mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation 
    summarize(mean_tp = mean(tp_ug),
              max_tp = max(tp_ug),
              min_tp = min(tp_ug),
              sd_tp = sd(tp_ug))

```

Create a third R chunk that uses the function `kable` in the knitr package to display two tables: one for the summary dataframe for total N and one for the summary dataframe of total P. Use the `caption = " "` code within that function to title your tables. Customize the chunk options such that the final table is displayed but not the code used to generate the table.

```{r kable, echo = FALSE}

# Create table of Nitrogen information using kable function 
n_table <- kable(LTER_summary_n, 
                 # Use caption code to title table 
                 caption = "Nitrogen Statistics Per Lake")
# Display table
n_table

# Create table of Phosphorous information using kable function 
p_table <- kable(LTER_summary_p, 
                 # Use caption code to title table
                 caption = "Phosphorous Statistics Per Lake")
# Display table 
p_table

```

Create a fourth and fifth R chunk that generates two plots (one in each chunk): one for total N over time with different colors for each lake, and one with the same setup but for total P. Decide which geom option will be appropriate for your purpose, and select a color palette that is visually pleasing and accessible. Customize the chunk options such that the final figures are displayed but not the code used to generate the figures. In addition, customize the chunk options such that the figures are aligned on the left side of the page. Lastly, add a fig.cap chunk option to add a caption (title) to your plot that will display underneath the figure.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "left", fig.cap = "Plot of nitrogen levels over time at data lakes"}

# Create a plot of total Nitrogen over time 
nPlot <- ggplot(LTER, 
                aes(x = sampledate, 
                    y = tn_ug, 
                    # Show different colors for each lake
                    color = lakename)) + 
  geom_point(size = 1.5, alpha = 0.7) + 
  labs(title = "Nitrogen Levels for Lakes",
       y = "Nitrogen (ug/L)",
       x = "Date", 
       color = "Lake:") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5)) + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2")

# Show plot
nPlot

```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "left", fig.cap = "Plot of phosphorous levels over time at data lakes"}

# Create a plot of total Phosphorous over time 
pPlot <- ggplot(LTER, 
                aes(x = sampledate, 
                    y = tp_ug, 
                    # Show different colors for each lake 
                    color = lakename)) + 
  geom_point(size = 1.5, alpha = .7) + 
  labs(title = "Phosphorous Levels for Lakes",
       y = "Phosphorous (ug/L)",
       x = "Date", 
       color = "Lake:") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5)) + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Accent")

# Show plot 
pPlot

```

### Communicating results

Write a paragraph describing your findings from the R coding challenge above. This should be geared toward an educated audience but one that is not necessarily familiar with the dataset. Then insert a horizontal rule below the paragraph. Below the horizontal rule, write another paragraph describing the next steps you might take in analyzing this dataset. What questions might you be able to answer, and what analyses would you conduct to answer those questions?

### Description of findings

In the upper midwest, there is a series of experimental lakes; these lakes have been home to an incredible series of experiments and time-series data tracking. The table summaries and charts above help capture pieces of information gathered through these experiments and this data. For instance, we can see that __Hummingbird Lake__ has the highest _average_ Phosphorous and Nitrogen levels. However, __East Long Lake__, __West Long Lake__, and __Peter Lake__ all have high Nitrogen and Phosphorous anomalies as told by their _max_ values. This information is substantiated by the _comparatively high standard deviations_ at East Long, West Long, and Peter Lakes. Visually, we can see these anomalies in the two charts of Nitrogen and Phosphorous levels at the lakes over time. For instance, those Nitrogen data points over 2000 ug/L belong to West Long Lake, East Long Lake, and Peter Lake. Likewise, those Phosphorous data points over 50 ug/L also belong to West Long Lake, East Long Lake, and Peter Lake. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description of next steps 

These initial results are promising, but deserve further exploration. This further analysis of the experimental lakes dataset could consider Nitrogen and Phosphorous values at _different depths_. It could also examine information gathered for other data points collected at the lake such as _Phosphate_, _Ammonia_, and _Ammonium_. Finally, further exploration could also contemplate _yearly distinctions_ in the previously-run statistics. 

## KNIT YOUR PDF

When you have completed the above steps, try knitting your PDF to see if all of the formatting options you specified turned out as planned. This may take some troubleshooting.

## OTHER R MARKDOWN CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS

We have covered the basics in class today, but R Markdown offers many customization options. A word of caution: customizing templates will often require more interaction with LaTeX and installations on your computer, so be ready to troubleshoot issues.

Customization options for pdf output include: 

* Table of contents
* Number sections
* Control default size of figures
* Citations
* Template (more info [here](http://jianghao.wang/post/2017-12-08-rmarkdown-templates/))

pdf_document:
